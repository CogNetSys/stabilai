Service Offerings

### **1. Cloud Platforms - *HuggingFace***
Cloud platforms form the backbone of most AI services. They provide compute power, storage, and pre-built AI/ML tools. The big players here are:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Includes services like SageMaker (for training/deploying ML models), Lambda (for serverless computing), and EC2 (for compute instances).
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Offers Vertex AI, BigQuery (data analytics), and TPU instances for AI workloads.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Known for Azure AI, Azure Machine Learning, and cognitive services (e.g., speech, language, and vision APIs).

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
Expect **40–60% of project costs** to go toward cloud usage. For example:
   - **Training models:** GPUs/TPUs for training can be very compute-intensive.
   - **Storage:** Storing large datasets.
   - **Deployment:** Hosting AI models on cloud endpoints or servers.

## **2. AI/ML Tools and Frameworks - *(StabilAI)***
These tools are used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Some require licensing or subscription fees. Popular tools include:

- **Open-source libraries** (free but resource-intensive): TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face.
- **Paid platforms and tools:** H2O.ai, DataRobot (automated ML), or AI-enhanced CRM tools like Salesforce Einstein.
- **AutoML solutions:** For companies seeking faster deployment with minimal manual coding.

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
**10–20%** if you’re relying on paid platforms/tools (or less if mostly open-source).

## **3. Data Acquisition and Preparation - *(DataForge Data Science Services)***  
AI thrives on data, so acquiring, cleaning, and preprocessing data is critical. This can include:

- **Data Sources:**
  - Public datasets (free or low-cost).
  - Paid proprietary datasets (e.g., healthcare, finance, market research data).
  - APIs for live data (e.g., social media sentiment, stock market APIs).
- **Data Labeling Services:** Labelbox, Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, or manual labeling teams.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Services to prepare data for analysis (e.g., AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory).

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
This phase often takes **10–25%** of customer dollars, especially for resource-heavy preprocessing and labeling tasks.

### **4. Specialized AI APIs and SaaS Tools**
For companies providing specific services (e.g., chatbots, sentiment analysis, image recognition), pre-built APIs and SaaS tools reduce development time and costs. Examples include:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
      - OpenAI (GPT models), Google NLP API, Microsoft LUIS.
- **Vision AI:**
     - Google Vision AI, AWS Rekognition, or custom-trained models.
- **Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech/Voice AI:**
     - Assembly AI, Grok Cloud Whisper, 11 Labs TTS.
- **Chatbots and Conversational AI:**
      - Dialogflow (Google), Amazon Lex, or GPT-based tools.

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
**10–20%** depending on how reliant you are on these services.

---

## **5. Compute Infrastructure and DevOps (*CompTechEdge Hardware Sales*)**  
Maintaining infrastructure for development, testing, and deployment is a constant expense. Examples include:

- **DevOps tools**: Docker, Kubernetes for managing deployments.
- **Monitoring tools**: Datadog, Prometheus for performance tracking.
- **Edge AI services** (if applicable): Deploying models at the edge (e.g., on IoT devices) using platforms like Nvidia Jetson or AWS Greengrass.

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
Roughly **5–15%** of project budgets.

---

## **6. Professional Services (*DevAGI Consulting Group*)**
These services cover consulting, custom model development, and implementation. This is where your business expertise comes in. Examples include:

- Custom AI solutions tailored to the client’s specific needs.
- Ongoing support and optimization of AI models.
- AI training programs for client teams.

**Customer Dollar Allocation:**  
**15–30%** for labor costs, expertise, and project management.

### **Example Breakdown of Customer Dollar Allocation:**
For a hypothetical project:

- **Cloud Platforms:** (40%)
- **AI/ML Tools:** (15%)
- **Data Preparation:** (15%)
- **Specialized APIs:** (10%)
- **Compute Infrastructure/DevOps:** (10%)
- **Professional Services (Consulting, Development):** (10%)

The exact percentages will vary depending on the complexity of the project, the reliance on cloud resources vs. local infrastructure, and whether you’re using open-source tools or paid platforms.
